# Deploy WordPress HTML Pages to GitHub Pages

## Tasks
- [ ] Update .github/workflows/pages.yml to deploy from wordpress-export instead of services/landing/public
- [ ] Ensure CNAME file is copied to out/ for custom domain
- [ ] Test deployment by pushing to main branch
- [ ] Verify pages load on tiltcheck.me

## Notes
- wordpress-export contains all static HTML pages ready for deployment
- No conversion needed as files are already HTML
- CNAME is set to tiltcheck.me
