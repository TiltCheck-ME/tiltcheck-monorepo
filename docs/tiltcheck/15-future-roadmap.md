# 15. Future Roadmap
This roadmap outlines the phased evolution of the TiltCheck ecosystem.  
Timelines are flexible — built for a solo founder with limited funding, meaning progress follows opportunity, grants, and available resources.

All features are modular, optional, and can be released independently.

---

# 15.1 Philosophy of Development

TiltCheck evolves according to 3 principles:

### **1. Ship the most helpful modules first**
Anything that reduces chaos, scams, or degen confusion gets priority.

### **2. Avoid over-building**
No big bangs.  
No massive frontend builds.  
Discord-first until scaling *demands* a UI.

### **3. Optimize for free-tier resources**
Cloudflare  
Supabase  
GitHub Actions  
Magic  
Open libraries  
Jupiter  
Public APIs  

TiltCheck’s roadmap assumes scrappy resourcefulness.
