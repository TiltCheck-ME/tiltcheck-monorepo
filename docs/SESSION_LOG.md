# Session Log

## 2026-10-13 — feat: Touch Grass games hub

`/touch-grass` replaces the crisis page as the games hub (Live Trivia + Degens Against Decency). Crisis copy lives on the footer/legal only. Pro overlay iframes `?mode=pause` during the cover. DA&D is Discord-honest when there is no web client. No enforcement changes.

## 2026-10-13 — ci: patch HIGH CVEs + stop PR e2e from hitting GitHub Pages

PR e2e now boots local Next.js on 127.0.0.1:3001 (`PLAYWRIGHT_WEB_LOCAL=1`) so `/login` is the real app, not a Pages 404. GH Pages builder emits `/login/index.html` for the live twin. `pnpm audit:deps` overrides take published HIGH patches; advisories with no patched release warn instead of fail.

## 2026-10-13 — copy: honest Core vs Pro + Cooldown discoverability

Public copy now says Core is a two-second spin lock; fullscreen Touch Grass (~2 min) is Pro only. Cooldown is first in the tool registry, dual-primary on home, and linked from tools, getting-started, dashboard Safety, and the extension popup. Guest popup opens on Guards. No enforcement default changes.

## 2026-10-13 — guard: AutoClaimer never ships in the player build

CI walker `scripts/guard-no-autoclaimer.mjs` fails Brand Law if AutoClaimer identifiers return under apps/ or packages/. Closes #545. No product UI. No runtime kill switch.

## 2026-10-13 — feat(cooldown): on-chain self-exclusion registry v2

### Summary

Shipped the Cooldown on-chain self-exclusion system (devnet live). Key components added or modified:

- `programs/cooldown/` — Anchor/Solana program for the self-exclusion registry (PDA-based lock accounts, set/extend, scope: all/category/game)
- `packages/cooldown-sdk/` — TypeScript SDK (`isLocked`, `setLock`, `extendLock`, `hashTarget`, `zeroTarget`, `SCOPE_ALL`, `SCOPE_GAME`)
- `apps/api/src/routes/cooldown.ts` + `tips.ts` — API routes for cooldown checks and tip log reads
- `apps/web/src/app/cooldown/` — Lock page and demo casino page
- `modules/justthetip/src/tilt-hint.ts` + `tip-log.ts` — JustTheTip tilt hint and tip velocity tracking
- `apps/chrome-extension/src/chase-warning.ts` + `spin-pace-lock.ts` — Browser extension superpowers: loss-chase warning and spin pace enforcement
- CI workflows updated to `ubuntu-24.04` and Node 22
- `apps/web/src/components/TrustRollup.tsx` — Placeholder replaced with live placeholder wiring

### PR hygiene fixes (post-review)

- Fixed TypeScript type predicate error in `apps/web/src/lib/docs.ts` (`lastUpdated` made required in `DocMetadata`, was always provided)
- Fixed copyright header format in `modules/justthetip/src/index.ts`
- Removed unused variables (`RANK_NAME`, `SUIT_NAME`) and unreachable function (`normalizeCard`) from poker coach userscript
- Updated README Cooldown SDK/API section to match actual SDK exports (`isLocked`/`setLock` vs old `isExcluded`/`createLock`)
