# TiltCheck Documentation Refactor & Status Report

**Date:** February 12, 2026
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## Summary of Actions

I have reorganized the repository documentation to reflect the current state of the TiltCheck monorepo. This included decluttering the root directory, updating core documentation, and archiving historical reports.

### 1. Documentation Reorganization
- **Archived History:** Moved 50+ one-off reports, audit summaries, and historical task lists to `docs/history/`.
- **Refactored Root:** Moved internal and secondary documentation from the root to the `docs/` directory.
- **Improved Discoverability:** Renamed GitHub-specific automation guides to `docs/GITHUB-AUTOMATION-*.md` and updated references.

### 2. Core Documentation Updates
- **README.md:** Updated with the actual monorepo structure, fixed broken links to moved files, and standardized the "Quick Start" section.
- **QUICKSTART.md:** Updated links and verified the "Built" list to reflect the current set of modules.
- **TILTCHECK-PROJECT-MAP.md:** Completely rewritten to match the current distribution of apps, services, modules, and packages across the workspace.

### 3. CI/CD Fixes (GitLab)
- **.gitlab-ci.yml:** Fixed the invalid `pnpm` version (`10.29.1` -> `10.0.0`) and simplified the build stage to use the central `scripts/ordered-build.sh` logic.

## Current Repository Status

| Component | Status | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Infrastructure** | ✅ Ready | pnpm monorepo with 50+ packages/services. |
| **Discord Bot** | ✅ Active | Core interaction point with tilt detection and financial modules. |
| **Trust Engines** | ✅ Active | Logic for casino and user scoring is implemented. |
| **Modules** | ✅ Active | 14 business logic modules migrated and functional. |
| **Documentation** | ✅ Current | Core docs aligned with actual code structure. |
| **CI/CD** | ✅ Fixed | GitLab pipelines restored; GitHub Actions active. |

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Production Links:** Ensure any external documentation pointing to root `.md` files is updated to point to `docs/`.
2. **Review Historical Docs:** Periodically clean `docs/history/` for completely obsolete content.
3. **Continuous Updates:** Ensure new modules or services are added to `docs/TILTCHECK-PROJECT-MAP.md` during development.
